Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form? 
So that the form works correctly and so it is organized.  That way, someone can look at the code
and understand what each section is referring to.

What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML?
You can read code from other people and understand it, also people can understand your code. 

What are some disadvantages?
it takes a little bit longer to write semantic html and there are not many semantic elements to choose from.
