Why are ID selectors a bad idea? 
ID selectors are a bad idea because they can be confused with javascript.  ID selectors are
high on the specificity scale and so it is not a good idea to use them unless you are using javascript
so that you can differentiate between how you code using html/css and javascript.  

What selectors should you prefer when working with CSS?
The selectors that are preferible when working with CSS are classes, elements, and attributes
because they are lower on the specificity scale and can be used to style the desired portions of html.
