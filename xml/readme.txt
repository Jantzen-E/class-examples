How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
You can use the same style of coding where you have nested information to
show how the information should be organized.

What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?
The benefits are that you can create your own tags and be creative with how
you write it and how you choose to organize your information.

What are some disadvantages?
Some disadvantages are that xml is so flexible that if you write a long file
that contains a lot of information you might have some tags that don't match
up or that disagree with each other so you have to be careful.
