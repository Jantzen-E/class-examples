What is FIZZBUZZ?

FIZZBUZZ is a game where you count from 1-100 and for every number that is
divisible by 3, you say FIZZ and for every number that is divisible by 5,
you say BUZZ.  If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you say FIZZBUZZ.

I have been told that many tech companies use FIZZBUZZ as a coding challenge in 
the interview process and so I decided to make a video showing 3 different solutions
for the FIZZBUZZ coding challenge.

I am a beginner and my syntax is not 100% correct but the 3 loops I will show for the 
solutions will hopefully be helpful to some of you.
